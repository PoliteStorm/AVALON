# Fungal Electrical Activity Analysis Results

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive analysis of fungal electrical activity patterns observed through wavelet transform analysis.

## Methodology
We employed a specialized square root wavelet transform:
```
W(k,τ) = ∫₀^∞ V(t) · ψ(√t/τ) · e^(-ik√t) dt
```

This transform was chosen for its ability to capture the unique characteristics of fungal electrical signals, particularly:
- Non-linear temporal evolution
- Multi-scale patterns
- Phase relationships
- Frequency-dependent behaviors

## Key Findings

### 1. Multi-Scale Communication Architecture
- Discovery of hierarchical organization in fungal electrical signals
- Multiple frequency bands operating simultaneously
- Evidence of scale-dependent information channels
- Organized distribution of significant events

### 2. Temporal Patterns
- Regular rhythmic activity at specific scales
- Burst patterns indicating coordinated responses
- Long-term trends in electrical activity
- Cross-scale interactions

### 3. Environmental Response Patterns
- Clear electrical responses to moisture changes
- Adaptation patterns in signal characteristics
- Evidence of systemic signal propagation
- Scale-specific environmental responses

### 4. Signal Characteristics
- Complex phase relationships across scales
- Distinct frequency components
- Non-random organization of significant events
- Evidence of information encoding in multiple dimensions
