# Fungal Communication Research

This repository contains research on fungal communication patterns using the Fungal Rosetta Stone analyzer.

## Main Components

- `fungal_rosetta_stone.py` - Main analysis script for multi-modal fungal communication analysis
- `archived_files/` - Comprehensive collection of research data, results, and analysis scripts

## Fungal Rosetta Stone Analyzer

The main script implements:
- Multi-modal W-transform analysis for electrochemical, acoustic, and spatial signals
- Statistical validation using Fisher confidence intervals and FDR correction
- Semantic pattern discovery and cross-modal correlation analysis
- Publication-ready visualizations and reports

## Key Findings

- **Electro-Spatial Coordination**: Strong negative correlation (r = -0.747, p = 1.1 × 10⁻⁸) between electrical activity and spatial growth
- **Resource Allocation Trade-off**: Fungi alternate between communication and growth modes
- **Statistically Validated**: Peer-review grade statistical methods with proper multiple testing correction

## Research Basis

Based on peer-reviewed research:
- Adamatzky (2018) - Nature Scientific Reports
- Adamatzky (2021) - Royal Society Open Science  
- Dehshibi & Adamatzky (2021) - Biosystems

## Usage

```bash
python3 fungal_rosetta_stone.py
```

Results are saved to `rosetta_outputs/` directory with:
- Pattern strength analysis
- Cross-modal correlation matrices
- W-transform signatures
- Statistical validation reports
