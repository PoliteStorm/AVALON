Fungal Rosetta Stone Tutorial
=============================

This notebook demonstrates the end-to-end workflow for analyzing multi-modal fungal communication data using the `FungalRosettaStone` toolkit. We will load the analyzer, generate synthetic data for three modalities, and produce the final summary visualization.

1. Import Necessary Libraries
-----------------------------

First, we need to import the `FungalRosettaStone` class and other necessary libraries like `Path`.

.. code-block:: python

   import sys
   from pathlib import Path

   # Add the project root to the Python path to allow importing the module
   project_root = Path().absolute().parent
   if str(project_root) not in sys.path:
       sys.path.insert(0, str(project_root))

   from fungal_rosetta_stone import FungalRosettaStone, _demo

2. Run the Demonstration
------------------------

The `_demo()` function provides a complete, self-contained example of the analysis pipeline. It initializes the analyzer with the standard configuration, creates synthetic datasets for the electrochemical, acoustic, and spatial modalities, runs the full analysis, and generates all outputs.

The final output is a multi-panel plot summarizing the discovered semantic patterns and their statistical significance.

.. code-block:: python

    # The _demo function prints status updates and displays the final plot
    _demo()

3. Understanding the Output
---------------------------

The plot generated by the demo showcases the key findings of the analysis:

- **(A) Semantic Pattern Strengths**: This bar chart shows the strength of discovered high-level patterns, such as `electro_acoustic_coupling`. The strength is based on the distance correlation, a robust non-linear metric.
- **(B) Cross-modal Correlations**: This heatmap visualizes the pairwise correlations between the three modalities (Electrical, Acoustic, and Spatial).
- **(C) W-transform Signature**: This shows the W-transform magnitude for the electrical signal, highlighting the dominant time-scale (Ï„) and frequency (k) components.
- **(D) Pattern Validation**: This chart displays the statistical significance (FDR-corrected p-values) for the discovered patterns, with a reference line for the chosen significance level.
