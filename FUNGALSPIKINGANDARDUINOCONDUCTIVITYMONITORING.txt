## 1. INTRODUCTION

Electronically conductive mushrooms represent an emerging field at the intersection of mycology and materials science. By cultivating mushrooms on substrates with specific mineral compositions and using techniques like calcination and specialized pasteurization, it's possible to develop fungal materials with enhanced electrical conductivity properties.

This guide focuses on two critical aspects of conductive mushroom cultivation:
1. Fungal spiking techniques to optimize mycelial growth and conductivity
2. Arduino-based monitoring systems to measure and track conductivity development

## 2. FUNGAL SPIKING TECHNIQUES

### 2.1 Definition and Purpose

Fungal spiking is the process of introducing mycelium (mushroom spawn) into multiple points throughout a substrate, rather than just at the surface or in a single location. This technique accelerates colonization, improves resilience against contamination, and ensures more uniform development of the mycelial network.

For conductive mushroom applications, proper spiking is particularly important as it:
- Creates more uniform electrical properties throughout the substrate
- Develops more interconnected mycelial networks for better conductivity
- Ensures consistent incorporation of conductive minerals from the substrate

### 2.2 Methods of Fungal Spiking

#### 2.2.1 Layering Method
The layering method involves alternating layers of substrate and spawn:

1. Prepare container with drainage holes if needed
2. Add 1/3 of the substrate material to the container
3. Spread 1/4 of the spawn evenly across the surface
4. Add another 1/3 of substrate
5. Spread another 1/4 of spawn
6. Add final 1/3 of substrate
7. Spread another 1/4 of spawn on top
8. Reserve the final 1/4 of spawn for the spike method below

This method ensures spawn is distributed throughout the vertical profile of the substrate.

#### 2.2.2 Spike Method
The spike method involves creating holes in the substrate and filling them with spawn:

1. After completing the layering method, use a sterilized tool (dowel, PVC pipe, etc.) to create vertical holes in the substrate
2. Space holes in a grid pattern, approximately 3-4 inches (7.5-10 cm) apart
3. Make holes 2-3 inches (5-7.5 cm) deep
4. Fill each hole with spawn from your reserved portion
5. Lightly cover the holes with substrate

#### 2.2.3 Mix Method
For smaller batches or when using sawdust-based substrates:

1. Place substrate in a clean container
2. Add spawn at 10-30% of substrate weight
3. Mix thoroughly until spawn is evenly distributed
4. Pack into final growing container

### 2.3 Optimizing for Conductivity

When spiking for conductive mushroom applications:

1. **Mineral Distribution**: Ensure calcined materials or mineral supplements are evenly distributed before spiking
2. **Moisture Gradient**: Create a slight moisture gradient with higher moisture at the bottom to encourage vertical mycelial growth
3. **Electrode Placement**: If using embedded electrodes, place them during the spiking process, ensuring good contact with substrate
4. **Species Selection**: Different mushroom species have varying abilities to incorporate minerals:
   - Pleurotus ostreatus (Oyster mushroom) - Good general conductivity
   - Ganoderma lucidum (Reishi) - Excellent for mineral incorporation
   - Trametes versicolor (Turkey Tail) - Forms dense mycelial networks

### 2.4 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Possible Cause | Solution |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| Uneven colonization | Poor spawn distribution | Use more spawn points, ensure even distribution |
| Slow growth | Excessive mineral content | Reduce concentration of calcined materials |
| Contamination | Inadequate pasteurization | Increase pasteurization time or pH |
| Poor conductivity | Insufficient mineral uptake | Add chelated minerals, adjust pH to 6.5-7.0 |
| Mycelium avoids certain areas | Toxic mineral concentration | Reduce concentration, leach substrate before use |

## 3. SUBSTRATE PREPARATION

### 3.1 Calcination Process

Calcination at approximately 620°C transforms minerals into more bioavailable forms and can significantly enhance the conductive properties of the final mycelium.

#### 3.1.1 Materials for Calcination
- Calcium sources: limestone, eggshells, seashells
- Mineral-rich materials: clay, certain soils, mineral deposits
- Plant ashes: hardwood ash, rice hull ash

#### 3.1.2 Calcination Procedure
1. Crush materials to increase surface area (1-5mm particles ideal)
2. Place in heat-resistant containers (ceramic crucibles)
3. Use a kiln or furnace capable of precise temperature control
4. Heat gradually to 620°C (rate of 5-10°C per minute)
5. Hold at target temperature for 2-3 hours
6. Cool slowly to prevent cracking and to stabilize crystal structures
7. Grind calcined material to fine powder
8. Store in airtight container until use

#### 3.1.3 Safety Considerations
- Wear appropriate heat-resistant gloves and eye protection
- Ensure adequate ventilation as calcination releases CO₂ and potentially other gases
- Allow materials to cool completely before handling
- Wear dust mask when grinding calcined materials

### 3.2 Pasteurization Methods

Various pasteurization methods affect mineral availability and subsequent conductivity:

#### 3.2.1 Cold Lime Water Pasteurization
1. Mix 1 cup hydrated lime (calcium hydroxide) with 5 gallons water
2. Soak substrate for 12-24 hours
3. Drain to field capacity (squeeze and get a few drops)
4. Mix with calcined materials at 5-10% of substrate weight
5. Add spawn using spiking methods above

Benefits: High pH (12+) prevents contaminants, adds calcium for conductivity

#### 3.2.2 Cold Ash Water Pasteurization
1. Mix 2 cups hardwood ash with 5 gallons water
2. Let sit for 24 hours, stirring occasionally
3. Strain out solids
4. Soak substrate for 12-24 hours
5. Drain to field capacity
6. Mix with calcined materials and spawn

Benefits: Adds potassium and trace minerals, creates alkaline environment

#### 3.2.3 Soap and Bleach Pasteurization
For soap method:
1. Add 1 tablespoon soap (without additives) to 5 gallons water
2. Soak substrate for 24 hours
3. Rinse thoroughly
4. Drain to field capacity

For bleach method:
1. Add 1/4 cup bleach to 5 gallons water (50ppm)
2. Soak substrate for 6-12 hours
3. Rinse thoroughly until no bleach smell remains
4. Drain to field capacity

Note: These methods may reduce mineral availability compared to lime or ash methods.

### 3.3 Mineral Supplementation

To enhance conductivity, consider these supplements:

1. **Iron sulfate**: 0.1-0.5% of dry substrate weight
2. **Copper sulfate**: 0.05-0.2% of dry substrate weight (use cautiously)
3. **Manganese sulfate**: 0.1-0.3% of dry substrate weight
4. **Zinc sulfate**: 0.05-0.2% of dry substrate weight
5. **Chelated mineral mixes**: Follow manufacturer recommendations

Add minerals after pasteurization but before spiking. Dissolve in water and spray evenly over substrate, or mix as dry powder.
