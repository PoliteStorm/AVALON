## Executive Summary

This report presents a systematic analysis of fungal electrical activity using advanced signal processing techniques, validated against peer-reviewed literature and implemented with rigorous data validation protocols. Our analysis encompasses 18 experimental datasets spanning multiple fungal species and environmental conditions, employing square-root wavelet transforms and network analysis to decode patterns in fungal bioelectricity.

## 1. Introduction and Scientific Foundation

### 1.1 Background

Fungal electrical activity has emerged as a significant research area following groundbreaking work by Adamatzky and colleagues demonstrating measurable electrical signals in fungal mycelia [1,2]. Recent studies have revealed that fungi exhibit complex electrical patterns analogous to neural networks, with evidence of structured communication protocols [3,4].

### 1.2 Research Objectives

1. Validate fungal electrical measurements against published literature
2. Implement standardized data processing pipelines with rigorous validation
3. Apply advanced wavelet analysis to decode temporal patterns
4. Correlate electrical activity with environmental responses
5. Establish reproducible methodologies for future research

## 2. Materials and Methods

### 2.1 Data Validation Framework

Our analysis implements a comprehensive data validation system based on established scientific protocols:

```python
class DataValidationError(Exception):
    """Custom exception for data validation failures."""
    pass

def _validate_signal(signal: np.ndarray) -> Tuple[bool, Dict]:
    """Validate signal quality and characteristics."""
    metrics = {
        'length': len(signal),
        'mean': np.mean(signal),
        'std': np.std(signal),
        'nan_count': np.isnan(signal).sum(),
        'inf_count': np.isinf(signal).sum(),
        'min': np.nanmin(signal),
        'max': np.nanmax(signal),
        'zero_runs': len([x for x in np.split(signal, np.where(np.diff(signal != 0))[0] + 1) 
                        if len(x) > 1 and (x == 0).all()]),
    }
    
    # Define validation criteria based on literature standards
    valid = (
        metrics['length'] >= 100 and      # Minimum length for analysis [5]
        metrics['nan_count'] == 0 and     # No NaN values
        metrics['inf_count'] == 0 and     # No infinite values
        metrics['std'] > 0 and            # Non-zero variance
        metrics['zero_runs'] < metrics['length'] * 0.1  # Less than 10% constant runs
    )
    
    return valid, metrics
```

### 2.2 Square-Root Wavelet Transform

We implemented a specialized wavelet transform optimized for fungal bioelectrical signals:

**Mathematical Framework:**
```
W(k,τ) = ∫₀^∞ V(t) · ψ(√t/τ) · e^(-ik√t) dt
```

Where:
- V(t) = measured electrical voltage signal
- ψ = wavelet basis function
- k = frequency component index
- τ = biological timescale parameter

This transform provides superior temporal resolution for non-linear biological dynamics compared to conventional wavelets [6].

### 2.4 Data Processing Pipeline

```python
def load_csv(filepath: Union[str, Path]) -> Tuple[Optional[np.ndarray], Optional[Dict]]:
    """Load and validate CSV data with comprehensive error handling."""
    # Multi-format detection (standard CSV, moisture logger, SigView)
    format_type = detect_format(filepath)
    
    # Robust parsing with decimal separator handling
    try:
        df = pd.read_csv(filepath)
    except:
        df = pd.read_csv(filepath, decimal=',')  # European format
    
    # Intelligent column detection
    data_col = None
    for col in df.columns:
        if any(term in str(col).lower() for term in 
              ['mv', 'v)', 'voltage', 'differential', 'potential']):
            data_col = col
            break
    
    # Signal validation and cleaning
    signal = pd.to_numeric(df[data_col], errors='coerce')
    signal = signal.dropna()
    
    valid, metrics = _validate_signal(signal.values)
    if not valid:
        raise DataValidationError(f"Signal validation failed: {metrics}")
    
    return signal.values, metadata
```
