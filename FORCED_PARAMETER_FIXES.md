# Forced Parameter Fixes for Fair Fungal Spiking Analysis

## 🔍 **Problem Identified**

The `ultra_simple_scaling_analysis.py` contained several **forced parameters** that could cause unfair testing by imposing arbitrary constraints that don't align with Adamatzky's actual fungal spiking research.

## 🧬 **Adamatzky's Actual Fungal Spiking Research**

### **Temporal Characteristics**
- **Very slow spikes**: 2656 ± 278 seconds (44 minutes) between spikes
- **Slow spikes**: 1819 ± 532 seconds (30 minutes) between spikes  
- **Very fast spikes**: 148 ± 68 seconds (2.5 minutes) between spikes

### **Amplitude Characteristics**
- **Very slow spikes**: 0.16 ± 0.02 mV
- **Slow spikes**: 0.4 ± 0.10 mV
- **Very fast spikes**: 0.36 ± 0.06 mV

### **Species-Specific Spike Rates**
- **Schizophyllum commune**: 0.1-2.0 Hz (multiscalar electrical spiking)
- **Pleurotus species**: 0.01-1.0 Hz (variable patterns)
- **Reishi/Bracket fungi**: 0.001-0.1 Hz (slow, sparse patterns)

### **Sampling Rate**
- **Adamatzky used**: 1 Hz (not 1 kHz as assumed)

## 🚫 **Forced Parameters Found & Fixed**

### **1. Fixed Spike Rate Constraints (LINES 325-330)**
**BEFORE:**
```python
# Biologically plausible spike count: 5-50 spikes/minute
min_bio_spikes = int(signal_duration_min * 5)
max_bio_spikes = int(signal_duration_min * 50)
```

**PROBLEM:** This forced ALL signals to have 5-50 spikes/minute, ignoring species differences.

**AFTER:**
```python
# ADAPTIVE: Species-specific spike rate expectations based on Adamatzky's research
if signal_complexity > 0.1:  # High complexity = more active species
    min_spikes_per_min = 0.1  # Very slow species (Reishi)
    max_spikes_per_min = 2.0  # Very fast species (Pleurotus pulmonarius)
elif signal_complexity > 0.05:  # Medium complexity
    min_spikes_per_min = 0.05  # Slow species
    max_spikes_per_min = 1.0   # Medium species
else:  # Low complexity = less active species
    min_spikes_per_min = 0.01  # Very slow species
    max_spikes_per_min = 0.5   # Slow species
```

### **2. Fixed Refractory Period (LINES 323-325)**
**BEFORE:**
```python
min_refractory_ms = 10  # 10 ms minimum interval between spikes
min_distance = int(sampling_rate * min_refractory_ms / 1000.0)
```

**PROBLEM:** 10ms is completely unrealistic for fungal spikes (Adamatzky measured 30 seconds to 44 minutes).

**AFTER:**
```python
# ADAPTIVE: Species-specific refractory periods based on Adamatzky's research
if signal_duration_sec > 3600:  # Long recordings (>1 hour)
    min_refractory_sec = 30  # 30 seconds minimum (Adamatzky's very fast spikes)
elif signal_duration_sec > 600:  # Medium recordings (10+ minutes)
    min_refractory_sec = 60  # 1 minute minimum (Adamatzky's slow spikes)
else:  # Short recordings
    min_refractory_sec = 10  # 10 seconds minimum (conservative)
```

### **3. Fixed Sampling Rate Assumption (LINE 322)**
**BEFORE:**
```python
sampling_rate = 1000.0  # Assume 1kHz sampling rate unless known
```

**PROBLEM:** Adamatzky used 1 Hz, not 1 kHz. This created a 1000x temporal mismatch.

**AFTER:**
```python
sampling_rate = 1.0  # Adamatzky's actual sampling rate
```

### **4. Fixed Amplitude Ranges (LINES 47-50)**
**BEFORE:**
```python
self.ADAMATZKY_RANGES = {
    "amplitude_min": 0.05,  # mV
    "amplitude_max": 50   # mV
}
```

**PROBLEM:** 50 mV is 100x larger than Adamatzky's actual measurements.

**AFTER:**
```python
self.ADAMATZKY_RANGES = {
    "amplitude_min": 0.02,  # mV (based on Adamatzky's very slow spikes: 0.16 ± 0.02)
    "amplitude_max": 0.5    # mV (based on Adamatzky's slow spikes: 0.4 ± 0.10)
}
```

### **5. Fixed Threshold Percentiles (LINES 318-320)**
**BEFORE:**
```python
p98 = np.percentile(signal_data, 98)
p95 = np.percentile(signal_data, 95)
p90 = np.percentile(signal_data, 90)
```

**PROBLEM:** Arbitrary percentiles don't account for species-specific characteristics.

**AFTER:**
```python
# ADAPTIVE: Calculate species-specific thresholds based on signal characteristics
variance_ratio = signal_variance / (signal_range + 1e-10)

# Adaptive percentiles based on signal characteristics
if variance_ratio > 0.1:  # High variance = more spikes expected
    percentiles = [85, 90, 95]  # Lower thresholds for high-variance signals
elif variance_ratio > 0.05:  # Medium variance
    percentiles = [90, 95, 98]  # Standard thresholds
else:  # Low variance = fewer spikes expected
    percentiles = [95, 98, 99]  # Higher thresholds for low-variance signals
```

### **6. Fixed Validation Thresholds (LINES 850-870)**
**BEFORE:**
```python
base_entropy = 0.3 + (variance_entropy_factor * 0.4) + (complexity_entropy_factor * 0.3)
threshold_factor = max(0.1, min(1.0, complexity_score / 2.0))
```

**PROBLEM:** Arbitrary thresholds that don't adapt to signal characteristics.

**AFTER:**
```python
# ADAPTIVE: Base entropy expectation based on signal characteristics
base_entropy = 0.1 + (variance_entropy_factor * 0.3) + (complexity_entropy_factor * 0.2)

# ADAPTIVE: Threshold based on signal characteristics
threshold_factor = max(0.05, min(0.5, complexity_score / max_possible_entropy))

# Only flag if entropy is suspiciously low for the signal characteristics
if complexity_data['shannon_entropy'] < adaptive_entropy_threshold and complexity_data['shannon_entropy'] < 0.1:
```
