MYCOFILTRATION COMPUTING: EXPLORATORY RESEARCH PROTOCOL
A Rudimentary Framework for Fungal-Based Computational Systems
INTRODUCTION
This document outlines experimental procedures for exploring the potential of mycofiltration (fungal filtration networks) as a biological computing mechanism. While conventional computing relies on electronic signals through silicon pathways, this approach investigates how mycelial networks can process inputs and generate outputs in ways that could theoretically perform computational functions.
THEORETICAL FOUNDATION
Mycofiltration computing operates on several key principles:

Mycelial networks can process different substances simultaneously
Fungi exhibit selective permeability and chemical transformation capabilities
Fungal enzymatic responses vary based on input combinations
Signal propagation occurs naturally through mycelial networks
Growth patterns and metabolic responses can encode information

MATERIALS REQUIRED

Oyster mushroom spawn (Pleurotus ostreatus) - recommended for rapid growth and resilience
Sterile straw or wood chips as substrate
3 clear plastic containers with lids (minimum 1L capacity each)
Small diameter food-grade plastic tubing
Syringes (for precise input introduction)
Food coloring (minimum 2 colors - red and blue recommended)
Coffee grounds
Food-grade hydrogen peroxide (3%, diluted to 0.5-1% for use)
pH indicator strips
Digital thermometer
Timer/stopwatch
Sterile gloves and 70% isopropyl alcohol
Optional: digital microscope for detailed observation
Notebook for manual data recording

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
PHASE 1: MYCELIUM NETWORK PREPARATION

Sterilize all containers and equipment using isopropyl alcohol
Prepare substrate:
a. Mix 80% moistened straw/wood chips with 20% coffee grounds (pre-used)
b. Sterilize substrate through pasteurization (soak in hot water at 70°C for 1-2 hours)
c. Allow to cool to room temperature
Inoculate substrate:
a. Add oyster mushroom spawn at 10-15% ratio to substrate weight
b. Mix thoroughly but gently to distribute evenly
c. Pack central container to 80% capacity
Incubation:
a. Maintain at 21-24°C (70-75°F)
b. Keep in indirect light (not direct sunlight)
c. Ensure high humidity (80-90%)
d. Allow 2-3 weeks for complete colonization
Preparation for experimentation:
a. Create small wells at input areas (2 locations)
b. Install tubing at input and output points
c. Seal all connections with silicone or wax to prevent leakage

PHASE 2: SYSTEM CONFIGURATION

Container setup:
a. Input Container A: Position to left of mycelium container, connect via tubing
b. Input Container B: Position to right of mycelium container, connect via tubing
c. Output Container: Place below mycelium container, connect via tubing from bottom
Input preparation:
a. Input A: 5% coffee grounds solution with red food coloring (5 drops per 100ml)
b. Input B: 0.5-1% hydrogen peroxide solution with blue food coloring (5 drops per 100ml)
System testing:
a. Verify all connections are secure
b. Test flow rates with plain water
c. Document baseline percolation time

PHASE 3: BASIC COMPUTATIONAL EXPERIMENTS
Experiment 1: Binary Input Processing (Logic Gate Simulation)

Four test conditions (run each 3 times):
a. Neither input (control)
b. Input A only (coffee solution + red dye)
c. Input B only (H₂O₂ solution + blue dye)
d. Both inputs simultaneously
Procedure:
a. Introduce 50ml of appropriate solution(s) to input points
b. Start timer immediately upon input introduction
c. Record time until first liquid appears at output
d. Collect output for 30 minutes
e. Allow system to rest for 12 hours between trials
Data collection:
a. Processing time (minutes:seconds)
b. Output volume (ml)
c. Output color (photograph and description)
d. Output pH
e. Visual changes in mycelium network

Experiment 2: Sequential Processing (Memory Investigation)

Introduce inputs in different sequences:
a. Input A followed by Input B after 30 minutes
b. Input B followed by Input A after 30 minutes
Procedure:
a. Introduce 50ml of first solution at appropriate input point
b. Wait precisely 30 minutes
c. Introduce 50ml of second solution at appropriate input point
d. Record as in Experiment 1
Additional data collection:
a. Compare results to simultaneous introduction
b. Document any evidence of "memory" effects (previous input affecting processing of subsequent input)

Experiment 3: Timing-Based Computation

Vary the concentration of inputs:
a. Coffee solution: 2.5%, 5%, 10%
b. H₂O₂ solution: 0.25%, 0.5%, 1%
Procedure:
a. Introduce 50ml of each concentration
b. Record filtration speed and transformation
c. Develop a calibration table relating concentration to processing time
