- 50% hardwood sawdust or wood chips
- 20% crushed oyster shells (finely ground to powder)
- 15% wheat bran
- 10% vermiculite
- 5% gypsum (calcium sulfate)
- Water to achieve 60-65% moisture content

The calcium carbonate in oyster shells can potentially enhance piezoelectric properties by creating mineral-rich structures within the mycelium network.
