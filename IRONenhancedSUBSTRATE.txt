- 45% hardwood sawdust
- 20% crushed oyster or snail shells
- 15% wheat bran
- 10% vermiculite
- 5% gypsum
- 5% iron sulfate solution (0.1-0.5% concentration, mixed with water)
- Water to achieve 60-65% moisture content

Preparation Methods
Sterilize all substrates at 15 PSI for 90-120 minutes in a pressure cooker or autoclave.
Allow to cool completely before inoculation.
Use oyster mushroom (Pleurotus species) spawn, which has shown promising results for bioelectronic applications.
4. Incubate in controlled conditions (temperature 21-24Â°C, humidity 85-95%).
After full colonization, subject to mild electrical stimulation during growth to potentially enhance piezoelectric properties.
