# Demonstrations

This directory contains demonstration scripts showing the practical applications of Joe's quantum consciousness research.

## Files

- `run_quantum_foam_analysis.py` - Demonstrates quantum foam analysis capabilities

## Purpose

These demonstrations showcase:
- Real-time quantum foam visualization
- Practical applications of the W-transform equation
- Interactive consciousness analysis
- Educational examples for understanding the research

## Usage

To run the quantum foam analysis demonstration:
```bash
python demonstrations/run_quantum_foam_analysis.py
```

## Educational Value

These demonstrations help:
- Understand complex quantum consciousness concepts
- Visualize multidimensional analysis
- See practical applications of theoretical work
- Validate research findings through interactive examples

## Requirements

All demonstrations are standalone and include their own dependencies to avoid conflicts with the main research environment.
