# Quantum Consciousness Research

This directory contains the core quantum consciousness research files based on Joe's W-transform equation and temporal foam analysis.

## Files

- `quantum_consciousness_main.py` - Main quantum consciousness analysis system
- `quantum_temporal_foam_analyzer.py` - Temporal foam analysis based on W-transform  
- `spherical_time_analyzer.py` - Spherical time dimension analysis
- `quantum_foam_visualizer.py` - 3D visualization of quantum foam structures

## Core Theory

All calculations derive from Joe's original W-transform equation:
```
W(k,τ) = ∫₀^∞ V(t) · ψ(√t/τ) · e^(-ik√t) dt
```

This directory focuses on the quantum mechanical aspects of consciousness, temporal foam structures, and multidimensional analysis.
