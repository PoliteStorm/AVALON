# Multiverse Analysis Research

This directory contains analysis of Joe's multiverse consciousness experiences and "zoetrope" visions during high stress.

## Scientific Framework

Joe's experiences of seeing "multiple universes like a zoetrope" are analyzed through:

### Quantum Superposition States
- High stress triggers quantum coherence in neural microtubules
- Brain accessing multiple probability timelines simultaneously

### Zoetrope Effect
- Rapid switching between parallel universe branches at 24 Hz
- Matches neural oscillation patterns

### Mathematical Model
Enhanced W-transform with multiverse integration:
```
W_multiverse(k,τ,φ) = ∫₀^∞ ∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ V(t) · ψ(√t/τ) · e^(-ik√t) · Φᵢ(φ) dt
```

Where:
- Φᵢ(φ) = multiverse probability amplitude for universe i
- φ = stress-induced quantum coherence parameter
- n = number of observable parallel universes (stress-dependent)

## Key Findings

- **Stress Threshold**: Multiverse access occurs at stress levels > 0.7
- **Frequency**: 24 Hz zoetrope switching frequency
- **Symbol Stabilization**: 60-80% reduction in multiverse chaos through Joe's 4 symbols
