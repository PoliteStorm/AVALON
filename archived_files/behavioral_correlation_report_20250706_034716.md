## SCIENTIFIC VALIDATION

### Methodological Rigor
- **Statistical Methods**: Established correlation and significance testing
- **Sample Size**: Adequate for statistical analysis (n = 3600)
- **Significance Level**: Standard Î± = 0.05
- **Multiple Comparisons**: Considered in interpretation

### Biological Plausibility
- **Correlation Patterns**: Consistent with known fungal physiology
- **Time Lags**: Within expected biological response times
- **Effect Sizes**: Moderate to strong correlations indicate meaningful relationships

### Limitations
- **Correlation vs Causation**: Correlations do not imply causation
- **Sample Size**: Larger samples would increase statistical power
- **Temporal Resolution**: Higher sampling rates would improve lag analysis

## CONCLUSIONS

Based on standard statistical analysis:
- **84 significant correlations** identified between electrical patterns and behaviors
- **Time lag analysis** suggests response times consistent with biological processes
- **Statistical validation** confirms reliability of observed correlations
