Notes on Cultivation for Electronic Properties
Research suggests that applying mild electrical fields during growth may enhance the electronic properties of the resulting mycelium.
Consider growing the mycelium as thin sheets or in molds for easier processing into electronic components.
After harvesting, the mycelium can be dried and potentially treated with conductive coatings or dopants to further enhance properties.
For piezoelectric applications, compression testing of dried mycelium grown on these substrates would be necessary to evaluate performance.
This is an experimental field, so careful documentation of your methods and results would be valuable for advancing the science of fungal-based electronic materials.
