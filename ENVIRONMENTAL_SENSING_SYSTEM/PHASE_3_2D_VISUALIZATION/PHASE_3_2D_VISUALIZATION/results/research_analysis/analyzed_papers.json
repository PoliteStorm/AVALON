IntroductionCorticosteroids are an effective treatment for many autoimmune and inflammatory diseases; however, there is a significant minority of patients across conditions who respond poorly [1]. Identification of predictive markers of corticosteroid response would eliminate exposure to an ineffective therapy and spare patients from significant adverse effects [2].

    "main_content": "IntroductionParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, leading to motor dysfunction. Common symptoms include resting tremor, muscle rigidity, bradykinesia and postural instability1,2. The disease is named after James Parkinson, a British physician who first described its symptoms in 1817. It affects approximately 1% of the population over the age of 60, and its prevalence is projected to double over the next 30 years3. Pathologically, PD is characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies, which are composed of aggregated alpha-synuclein protein. Recent research suggests that PD may originate from chronic inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract, leading to the misfolding of alpha-synuclein and its propagation to the brain via the blood\u2013brain barrier or the vagus nerve4,5. Current treatment for PD primarily relies on medications, such as those that increase dopamine levels, and in some cases, surgical interventions such as deep brain stimulation may be considered6,7. While there is no cure for PD, early diagnosis and comprehensive management can effectively alleviate symptoms and improve patients\u2019 quality of life.Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract, encompassing ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn\u2019s disease (CD). Patients with IBD often present with symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloody stools and weight loss. Diagnosis involves a combination of medical history, clinical symptoms, imaging studies and histopathological examination8,9. Treatment strategies include anti-inflammatory medications, immunosuppressive drugs, nutritional support and surgical interventions10,11. Early epidemiological studies have demonstrated a significantly increased risk of PD in patients with IBD, and biological evidence suggests that chronic low-grade intestinal inflammation in IBD may contribute to the pathogenesis of PD by disrupting the intestinal and blood\u2013brain barriers and triggering neuroinflammation12,13. With the advent of the gut-brain axis concept, the potential interplay between inflammation in PD and IBD has become a topic of growing interest. Genome-wide association studies have further revealed shared genetic risk variants between the two diseases, providing a genetic basis for their comorbidity14.Both PD and IBD are chronic conditions that require long-term management and treatment. Early diagnosis and aggressive therapy can help alleviate symptoms, reduce inflammation and improve overall quality of life. Despite the differences in their clinical presentations and underlying pathophysiology, PD and IBD share certain similarities15,16. Inflammation is likely to play a role in the development and progression of both diseases. Common inflammatory mediators may facilitate the interaction between the two conditions, suggesting the presence of interconnected biological mechanisms17,18. Therefore, this study aimed to identify common biomarkers of PD and IBD using publicly available Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets and compare multiple machine learning models to obtain optimal models for PD and IBD. By exploring potential therapeutic targets, this study seeks to provide novel insights into the co-diagnosis and treatment of PD and IBD.Materials and methodsData downloadThe overall workflow of our data analysis was illustrated in Fig. 1. The GSE7621 dataset, obtained from the GEO database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo), comprises data from substantia nigra tissue from postmortem brains of 16 PD patients (age range: 60\u201388 years, 11 males and 5 females) and 9 healthy individuals (age range: 46\u201388 years, 4 males and 5 females). Additionally, the GSE75214 dataset, also retrieved from GEO, includes data from mucosal biopsies obtained from the colon of 105 IBD patients (age range: 29\u201356 years, 57 males and 48 females, with 97 UC and 8 CD patients) and 11 healthy controls (age range: 62\u201373 years, 5 males and 6 females).Figure 1Flowchart diagram of search strategy.Full size imageIdentification of differentially expressed genes associated with IBD and PDDifferential gene expression analysis between IBD/PD and normal tissues was performed using the Limma software package. Genes exhibiting absolute log fold change (|logFC|) > 1 and false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 were considered differentially expressed. Subsequently, the top 10 upregulated and downregulated genes were identified and clustered using the pheatmap package.Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA)A gene co-expression network was constructed for the GSE7621 dataset using the R WGCNA package. Initially, the goodSamplesGenes function was employed to filter out missing genes and samples. Subsequently, the hclust function was utilized to cluster the samples and identify outlier samples for removal. Traditional methods for analyzing gene associations rely on ",
