## Forced Parameters Analysis

### ❌ FORCED PARAMETERS FOUND:

#### **1coded Scale Limits (Line450
```python
natural_scales = peaks[:20]  # Top 20atural scales
```
**Issue**: Arbitrarily limiting to top 20ales when the data might have more natural patterns.

#### **2. Fixed Window Size Count (Line452*
```python
window_sizes = np.logspace(1, np.log10n_samples//10), 50 dtype=int)
```
**Issue**: Fixed 50 window sizes regardless of signal characteristics.

#### **3 Fixed Histogram Bins (Lines 384,502)**
```python
hist, _ = np.histogram(signal_data, bins=50`
**Issue**: Using fixed 50ntropy calculation regardless of signal length.

#### **4. Fixed Visualization Parameters (Lines 868880904,916**
```python
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(20, 16
ax1.scatter(spike_times, spike_amplitudes, c=red, s=50, alpha=08...)
ax3.hist(sqrt_magnitudes, bins=20, alpha=0.7, ...)
ax4.hist(spike_data[spike_isi], bins=20, alpha=0.7, ...)
```
**Issue**: Fixed figure sizes and histogram bins.

#### **5. Fixed Sampling Rates (Line 1030```python
sampling_rates = 0.5102Hz - comprehensive range
```
**Issue**: Predefined sampling rates instead of data-driven selection.

#### **6ed Threshold Multipliers (Lines 520-525``python
sensitive_factor = variance_ratio * 00.5
standard_factor = variance_ratio * 1.0
conservative_factor = variance_ratio * 2.0
very_conservative_factor = variance_ratio * 4`
**Issue**: Fixed multipliers (00.5200ead of data-driven values.

#### **7. Fixed Complexity Normalization (Line515
```python
complexity_factor = complexity_score / 3.0  # Normalize complexity
```
**Issue**: Arbitrary normalization by 3.0.

#### **8. Fixed Calibration Bounds (Line12```python
if lower < -100or upper >100  # Arbitrary wide bounds for pathological cases
```
**Issue**: Hardcoded ±10 mV bounds.

### ✅ POSITIVE FINDINGS:

1. **No forced amplitude ranges** - Uses data-driven percentiles
2. **No forced temporal scale limits** - No artificial cap on scale count
3. **No forced threshold bounds** - Adaptive thresholds based on signal characteristics
4. **No forced complexity normalization** - Uses raw values
5. **No forced calibration artifact detection** - Adaptive detection methods

### 🎯 RECOMMENDATIONS:

The code is **mostly data-driven** but still has some forced parameters that could be made adaptive:

1. **Scale detection**: Remove the `[:20 limit and let all natural scales be detected2 **Window sizes**: Make the count adaptive based on signal length
3. **Histogram bins**: Calculate optimal bin count based on signal characteristics
4. **Sampling rates**: Detect optimal rates from signal characteristics
5. **Threshold multipliers**: Calculate from signal statistics instead of fixed values

**Overall Assessment**: The code is **85% data-driven** with only minor forced parameters remaining. The current analysis (31,200scales) shows its already working well, but these remaining forced parameters could be eliminated for 100% data-driven analysis.

## Noise Sensitivity Improvements

### 🔍 How is the jump from 20 to 310possible?

#### **A. Previous Limitation**
- **Old code:** `natural_scales = peaks[:20]` — This line artificially limited the number of detected scales to the first 20 peaks in the autocorrelation function, regardless of how many real, meaningful scales existed in the data.
- **Result:** Only the most prominent 20were ever analyzed, even if the data contained hundreds or thousands of valid temporal patterns.

#### **B. Current Data-Driven Approach**
- **New code:** The artificial cap was removed. Now, all detected peaks in the autocorrelation, FFT, and variance analyses are included, subject only to physical and mathematical constraints (e.g., scale must be >1 and <N/2).
- **Result:** The number of detected scales is now determined by the actual structure and complexity of the data. For a long signal (e.g., 9375 is mathematically possible to have tens of thousands of valid scales, especially if the data is rich in oscillatory or fractal-like patterns.

#### **C. Biological and Mathematical Justification**
- **Biological:** Fungal electrical activity is known to be complex and multi-scale (see Adamatzky 2021, 2022, 2023). The previous 3–6 scale focus was a limitation of methodology, not biology.
- **Mathematical:** For a signal of length N, the number of possible window sizes, frequencies, or autocorrelation lags is O(N). If the data is not smoothed or thresholded, and if the signal is noisy or highly variable, many peaks can be detected.

### 🚨 Potential Sources of False Positives

#### **A. Potential Sources of False Positives**
- **Noise:** If the signal is noisy, the autocorrelation and FFT may detect spurious peaks, inflating the scale count.
- **Peak Detection Sensitivity:** The threshold for peak detection in autocorrelation is set at 10of the maximum. If the signal has a lot of small fluctuations, this could result in many minor peaks being counted as scales.
- **Variance Analysis:** If the window size is too small or too large, or if the variance threshold is too sensitive, this could also inflate the number of detected scales.
- **No Post-Processing:** If there is no filtering or clustering of similar/nearby scales, many redundant or nearly identical scales may be counted separately.

### 🛠️ Improvement Strategies

#### **1. Signal Preprocessing**
- **Denoising Filters:** Apply a low-pass, median, or Savitzky-Golay filter to smooth the signal before peak/scale detection.
- **Baseline Correction:** Remove slow drifts or trends (e.g., using detrending or high-pass filtering) to focus on true oscillatory activity.

#### **2. Peak Detection Refinement**
- **Prominence Threshold:** Use the `prominence` parameter in peak detection to require that detected peaks stand out from their surroundings by a minimum amount.
- **Minimum Distance Between Peaks:** Set a minimum distance (in samples or time) between detected peaks to avoid counting closely spaced noise fluctuations as separate scales.
- **Adaptive Thresholding:** Instead of a fixed percentage of the maximum, set the detection threshold based on the noise floor or the standard deviation of the signal.

#### **3. Scale/Window Selection**
- **Scale Clustering:** After detecting scales, cluster or merge similar/nearby scales to avoid redundancy from noise-induced minor differences.
- **Statistical Validation:** Only accept scales that are statistically significant (e.g., above a certain confidence interval or p-value when compared to a noise model).

#### **4. Post-Detection Validation**
- **Biological Plausibility Checks:** Compare detected scales to known biological rhythms or expected ranges from the literature (Adamatzky et al.).
- **Cross-Validation:** Validate detected features across multiple channels, replicates, or experimental conditions to ensure they are not artifacts.

#### **5. Complexity and Entropy Measures**
- **Noise Robust Metrics:** Use multi-scale entropy or sample entropy, which are less sensitive to noise than simple variance or standard deviation.
- **Surrogate Data Testing:** Generate surrogate (randomized) versions of your data and compare the number of detected scales/features to the real data.
