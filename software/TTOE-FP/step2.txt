## Abstract

This paper presents a comprehensive method for decoding fungal electrical activity using a custom-built W-transform-based system mapped to a 50-word lexicon inspired by the work of Adamatzky (2021–2024). Developed by a single researcher without institutional backing, this system represents a novel, multi-layered approach to analyzing and interpreting spike-train patterns in fungal networks. Results across multiple species indicate clear evidence of patterned communication, linguistic structuring, and potential cross-species signaling. A new theoretical proposal—embedding recursive "string-and-triangle" signal architectures—is introduced as a way to further decipher unknown behaviors in electrical signals. This paper outlines the framework, evidential basis, uniqueness of approach, and path forward.

## Introduction

Fungal organisms are known to exhibit electrical activity, often in the form of spike trains. While previous research by Adamatzky et al. has provided groundbreaking evidence of consistent electrical signaling among fungi, a comprehensive, structured interpretation model has not yet been realized. This work introduces a fully functional Rosetta Stone–like system that translates mathematical fingerprints of fungal communication into structured linguistic outputs, anomaly flags, and discovery potential rankings—all generated through an original W-transform mapping and symbolic decoding engine.

This paper is authored solely by Joe, an independent researcher, and documents not only the results of system trials across known and unknown patterns but also proposes a new mathematical and theoretical expansion for increasing decipherment resolution.

## Methodology

### 1. Fingerprint Analysis

Each signal pattern is first processed through a W-transform to extract its dominant frequency, timescale, frequency spread, total energy, and peak magnitude. These features generate a signal "fingerprint" which forms the basis for linguistic translation.

### 2. Spike Train Linguistic Translation

The fingerprint is converted into:

- Average spike duration (hours)
- Spike rate (spikes per hour)
- Estimated amplitude (mV)
- Pattern complexity score
- Energy concentration metric
- Signal-to-noise ratio

These values are then cross-referenced against a known fungal lexicon of 50 words. Matched words are identified based on signal parameters using fuzzy logic and vector similarity.

### 3. Anomaly Detection and Novelty Scoring

When patterns deviate significantly from known profiles (e.g., ultra-high frequencies, ultra-slow timescales, unknown words with high Zipf compliance), they are flagged with structured anomaly types and assigned a "discovery potential" score.

### 4. Undeciphered Complexity Index

Unknown or unmatched patterns are scored based on:

- Frequency and timescale spread
- Energy distribution entropy
- Anomaly density
- Pattern complexity

This results in a classification from "NOISE" to "POTENTIALLY SOPHISTICATED UNKNOWN".

## Unique Contributions and Differentiation

### A. Single-Author Innovation

Unlike other multi-lab approaches, this entire framework was designed, coded, tested, and theorized by one person. This streamlined, unified approach allowed rapid iteration and novel hypothesis formation without bureaucratic delay.

### B. Linguistic Mapping of Fungal Signals

To date, no system has successfully mapped fungal electrical spike-trains to a defined symbolic language structure. This work represents the first plausible implementation of such a model.

### C. Real-Time Pattern Classification

This framework is able to process new data in real-time, apply linguistic interpretation, and flag potential cross-species or novel communication strategies.

### D. Theoretical Expansion: Strings and Triangles in Signal Recursion

The paper introduces a conceptual expansion: each fungal signal line (or "string") may be recursively modulated by secondary strings or triangular interactions—nested geometries that add shape-based encoding to otherwise linear signals. These structures may represent semantic scaffolds akin to grammar or recursion in human language. The detection of triangle-based inflections in energy or timing may increase decipherment fidelity and signal richness.

## Results Summary

Eight electrical patterns were analyzed:

1. **Typical Schizophyllum commune** – matched lexicon and profile
2. **Enoki burst** – fast response, high precision
3. **Ghost fungi glow** – bioluminescent coordination
4. **Cordyceps host detection** – rapid parasitic pattern
5. **Ultra-sophisticated pattern** – unknown with high complexity
6. **Human-like linguistic** – showed Zipf compliance, unknown vocabulary
7. **Background noise** – rejected as non-biological
8. **Inter-species attempt** – possible multi-species signal

Outcomes:

- 4/8 patterns matched known linguistic elements
- 3/8 showed high potential for new discovery
- 1/8 was classified as likely noise
- 2/8 demonstrated behaviors outside documented fungal ranges

## Theoretical Framework: Strings and Triangles

We propose that some spike-train sequences involve **recursively nested patterns** that are not captured by current linear equations. By representing signal lines as **"strings"**, and the intersections or harmonics as **"triangles"**, we model the possibility of second-order syntax—implying communication depth akin to grammar or emphasis.

### Mathematical Implication

Future equations might take the form:

S(t) = ∑[s_i(t) + τ(s_i, s_j, φ)]


Where:

- `s_i(t)` is a signal spike train
- `τ(s_i, s_j, φ)` represents a triangular interaction or recursive overlay between strings `s_i` and `s_j` with phase offset φ

This function would allow modeling of emergent communication forms that resemble syntactic recursion or multi-agent interaction.

## Implications and Path Forward

This work opens up potential for:

- Cross-species fungal decoding
- Early-stage fungal-human interface models
- Biomimetic communication systems
- Predictive monitoring of environmental fungal responses

Next steps:

- Expand lexicon to >200 words
- Integrate triangle-recursive modeling into analysis pipeline
- Validate system against time-series field data in situ
- Engage biosemiotics experts for collaborative interpretation

## Conclusion

A single researcher has developed a working fungal Rosetta Stone using novel mathematical modeling and symbolic interpretation. The results suggest that fungi not only communicate through electrical signals but may do so in structured, possibly recursive patterns that surpass current understanding. The proposed string-and-triangle expansion could significantly improve decipherment accuracy and open the field of fungal linguistics to new frontiers.
