Abstract

Fungi exhibit complex, often linguistically structured electrical signaling patterns across species and environmental conditions. Building upon foundational work by the Unconventional Computing Laboratory, this proposal introduces a novel visualization and analysis framework that applies the W-transform to map fungal spiking activity in a frequency–timescale spiral domain. This approach reveals semiotic structure, detects anomalous patterns, and may enable the classification or translation of non-human bioelectrical communication.

1. Background & Motivation

Recent studies led by Prof. Adamatzky have revealed that fungi such as Schizophyllum commune, Cordyceps militaris, and Flammulina velutipes emit electrical impulses with linguistic and communicative characteristics—most notably spike trains exhibiting Zipfian distributions, temporal structure, and inter-species variability.

While these spikes have been statistically categorized, a deeper semiotic or language-like decoding remains elusive. Existing time series and spectral analysis techniques struggle with the non-stationary, nonlinear, and biologically irregular nature of fungal electrophysiology.

This proposal aims to bridge that gap using a spiral-mapped W-transform (W(k, τ)) framework to both visualize and interpret these signals, extending the Unconventional Computing Lab’s existing tools into a new interpretive domain.

2. Objective

To develop a W-transform-based spiral visualization platform that:

- Projects fungal spike data into a radial (frequency) and angular (timescale/complexity) space.
- Highlights anomalous or “unknown” patterns with high linguistic potential.
- Reveals Rosetta Stone-like correlations between species.
- Enables real-time interactivity and simulation of fungal communication structures.

3. Methodology

3.1 Signal Analysis  
- Process recorded fungal voltage time series from previous lab datasets.  
- Compute the W-transform using a custom or modified integral kernel:

  W(k, τ) = ∫₀^∞ V(t) · ψ(√t/τ) · e^(-ik√t) dt

- Compare with traditional Fourier and wavelet transforms for benchmark.

3.2 Spiral Mapping & Classification  
- Map frequency (k) to radial distance.  
- Map timescale (τ) to angular position.  
- Use color, shape, and pulsation to denote energy, magnitude, species, or category (known, unknown, noise).

3.3 Anomaly Detection  
- Detect and visualize:
  - Zipf-like distributions  
  - Long-duration or ultra-rare spikes  
  - Synchronous or inter-species events  
- Implement interactive mode for toggling highlight layers, inspecting data, and simulating signal translation.

4. Preliminary Work

A working prototype has been developed featuring:

- Real-time W-domain spiral rendering on HTML5 canvas.  
- Eight fungal species and condition categories, including “Ultra-Sophisticated Unknown” and “Human-Like Linguistic Pattern.”  
- Controls for animation, highlighting anomalies, and viewing mathematical overlays.  
- Codebase ready for integration with live or recorded datasets.

Demo and code available upon request or via [GitHub link if you have one].

5. Proposed Collaboration with UCLab

- Integrate visualization platform with existing lab data repositories.  
- Run experimental signal simulations with Ganoderma, Pleurotus, or other novel species.  
- Co-author paper or conference abstract showcasing new insights from this analytic method.  
- Explore potential applications in fungal computing, biosemiotics, or plant-fungus interface protocols.

6. Expected Outcomes

- A refined computational tool for fungal signal interpretation.  
- New classification schema for previously uncharacterized spikes.  
- Potential emergence of "syntax units" or "bio-words" enabling fungal language models.  
- Contribution to interdisciplinary fields: unconventional computing, biosemiotics, and non-human communication studies.
