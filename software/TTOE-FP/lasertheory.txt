# Conceptualization of a DIY Photobiomodulation (PBM) Therapy Laser Device

## Objective
To build a low-level laser therapy (LLLT) / photobiomodulation (PBM) device capable of emitting specific therapeutic wavelengths for use in wound healing, pain relief, or anti-inflammatory treatment. The device is inspired by both empirical therapy protocols and signal-based biological response models.

## Core Design Overview

The device consists of:

1. **Optical Emission Subsystem**
2. **Electrical Power & Control Subsystem**
3. **Thermal Management Subsystem**
4. **Safety & Housing**
5. **(Optional) Signal Analysis Module**

## 1. Optical Emission

### Components:
- **Laser Diode or High-Power LED**
  - Wavelengths:
    - 660 nm (Red) — stimulates mitochondrial activity
    - 810–830 nm (Near-IR) — deeper pain modulation
    - 904 nm — inflammation reduction
  - Power Output: 5–100 mW typical range

- **Lens (Collimating or Focusing)**
  - G-2 or aspheric lens for beam shaping

---

## 2. Electrical Power & Control

### Components:
- **Laser Driver (Constant Current)**
  - Ensures safe operation and diode protection
  - Adjustable current delivery

- **Pulse Frequency Generator (optional)**
  - 555 timer IC or Arduino Nano
  - Allows pulsing at 10–1000 Hz for frequency-specific stimulation

- **Power Supply**
  - USB 5V or 12V DC input
  - Battery pack or wall adapter

---

## 3. Thermal Management

- **Heatsink** (Aluminum)
- **Cooling Fan** (if >50 mW continuous)

---

## 4. Safety & Housing

- **Enclosure** (aluminum, plastic, or 3D printed)
- **Interlock Switch / Keyed Power Switch**
- **Laser Safety Goggles**
  - Optical Density (OD) ≥ 3
  - Match wavelength (e.g. OD3 @ 660 nm)

## 5. Optional: Signal Processing Integration

If signal analysis of biological response is desired (e.g., mitochondrial bio-signals, O₂ saturation), the following applies:

### Mathematical Model (Conceptual)

W(k, τ) = ∫₀^∞ V(t) · ψ(√t / τ) · e^(–ik√t) dt


- **W(k, τ):** Wavelet transform coefficient at frequency k and scale τ  
- **V(t):** Biological signal (e.g., ATP oscillation, O₂ saturation)  
- **ψ():** Wavelet basis function  
- **e^(–ik√t):** Complex exponential component capturing oscillation

This can simulate how biological tissues respond in both time and frequency domains to PBM light modulation—particularly useful when modeling pulsed protocols or signal resonance with mitochondrial rhythms.

This model is not used to calculate the delivered energy or dose per se, but to understand how cells might process and react to structured stimulation over time.

## Energy Dose Estimation

Energy Density (J/cm²) = (Power Density mW/cm² × Time seconds) ÷ 1000

 
For example:  
20 mW/cm² × 600 seconds (10 min) = 12 J/cm²

Therapeutic range is often 1–10 J/cm² per session depending on depth and indication.

- ATP production enhancement
- Nitric oxide release
- ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species) modulation

### Secondary Effects:

## Safety Notes

- Follow IEC 60825-1 laser classification
- Use laser within Class 3B (<500 mW, with proper eye protection)
- Never operate device without appropriate goggles and beam safety
