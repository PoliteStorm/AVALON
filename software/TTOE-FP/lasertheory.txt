# Conceptualization of a DIY Photobiomodulation (PBM) Therapy Laser Device

## Objective
To build a low-level laser therapy (LLLT) / photobiomodulation (PBM) device capable of emitting specific therapeutic wavelengths for use in wound healing, pain relief, or anti-inflammatory treatment. The device is inspired by both empirical therapy protocols and signal-based biological response models.

## Core Design Overview

The device consists of:

1. **Optical Emission Subsystem**
2. **Electrical Power & Control Subsystem**
3. **Thermal Management Subsystem**
4. **Safety & Housing**
5. **(Optional) Signal Analysis Module**

## 1. Optical Emission

### Components:
- **Laser Diode or High-Power LED**
  - Wavelengths:
    - 660 nm (Red) — stimulates mitochondrial activity
    - 810–830 nm (Near-IR) — deeper pain modulation
    - 904 nm — inflammation reduction
  - Power Output: 5–100 mW typical range

- **Lens (Collimating or Focusing)**
  - G-2 or aspheric lens for beam shaping

## 2. Electrical Power & Control

### Components:
- **Laser Driver (Constant Current)**
  - Ensures safe operation and diode protection
  - Adjustable current delivery

- **Pulse Frequency Generator (optional)**
  - 555 timer IC or Arduino Nano
  - Allows pulsing at 10–1000 Hz for frequency-specific stimulation

- **Power Supply**
  - USB 5V or 12V DC input
  - Battery pack or wall adapter

## 3. Thermal Management

- **Heatsink** (Aluminum)
- **Cooling Fan** (if >50 mW continuous)

---

## 4. Safety & Housing

- **Enclosure** (aluminum, plastic, or 3D printed)
- **Interlock Switch / Keyed Power Switch**
- **Laser Safety Goggles**
  - Optical Density (OD) ≥ 3
  - Match wavelength (e.g. OD3 @ 660 nm)

## 5. Optional: Signal Processing Integration

If signal analysis of biological response is desired (e.g., mitochondrial bio-signals, O₂ saturation), the following applies:
