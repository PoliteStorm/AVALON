## Abstract

Photobiomodulation (PBM) therapy, also known as low-level light therapy (LLLT), represents an emerging therapeutic modality that employs specific wavelengths of light to stimulate cellular processes. This review examines the current state of PBM research, optimal therapeutic wavelengths, and the potential integration of artificial intelligence for treatment optimization. We analyze the scientific literature supporting various wavelength applications and discuss regulatory considerations for AI-enabled medical devices.

## 1. Introduction to Photobiomodulation Therapy

### 1.1 Definition and Mechanism

Photobiomodulation (PBM) therapy represents a treatment modality employing low-intensity light within the 300 to 1400 nm wavelength range. The primary mechanism involves cytochrome C oxidase enzyme activation in mitochondria, which alters gene expression and promotes cellular energy production.

### 1.2 Current Clinical Applications

Recent research has demonstrated PBM efficacy across multiple therapeutic areas:

- **Ophthalmology**: The Valeda system uses 3 specific wavelengths of light: yellow (590 nm), red (660 nm), and near-infrared (850 nm) for treating age-related macular degeneration
- **Wound healing**: 808-nm diode laser light promotes wound healing through increased reactive oxygen species production stimulating mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation
- **Neurovascular applications**: PBM therapy represents a novel treatment modality for brain diseases

## 2. Therapeutic Wavelengths: Evidence-Based Analysis

### 2.1 Red Light Spectrum (630-700 nm)

**Primary wavelength: 660 nm**
- **Mechanism**: Primary target for red light is the cytochrome C oxidase enzyme in mitochondria
- **Applications**: Surface tissue treatment, wound healing, anti-inflammatory effects
- **Evidence**: Multiple clinical studies support efficacy for surface-level therapeutic applications

### 2.2 Near-Infrared Spectrum (700-1000 nm)

**Key wavelengths: 808 nm, 830 nm, 850 nm**
- **808 nm**: Promotes wound healing of human endothelial cells through increased reactive oxygen species production
- **850 nm**: Used in FDA-reviewed systems for macular degeneration treatment
- **Advantages**: Enhanced tissue penetration depth, reduced light scattering

### 2.3 Pulsed Near-Infrared (900-910 nm)

**Primary wavelength: 905 nm**
- **Application**: Used in pulsed emission for anti-inflammatory applications
- **Mechanism**: Neural stimulation, inflammation reduction

### 2.4 Multi-wavelength Approaches

Multiwavelength photobiomodulation is emerging as a potential intervention to improve clinical and anatomical outcomes, with research focusing on synergistic effects of combined wavelengths.

## 3. Dosimetry and Treatment Parameters

### 3.1 Energy Density Calculations

The fundamental dosimetry equation remains:
**Energy Density (J/cm²) = (Power Density × Time) ÷ 1000**

However, laser radiation energy can be dosed as a whole or in a fractionated way with specific frequencies, suggesting that temporal distribution affects therapeutic outcomes.

### 3.2 Power Density Considerations

- **Low-power applications**: 5-200 mW/cm² for surface treatments
- **Penetration requirements**: Higher power densities (up to 500 mW/cm²) for deeper tissue applications
- **Safety margins**: Must remain below thermal damage thresholds (typically <1 W/cm²)

### 3.3 Treatment Duration and Frequency

Current research indicates:
- **Session duration**: 2-20 minutes depending on application
- **Treatment frequency**: Daily to weekly sessions
- **Course duration**: 2-12 weeks for most conditions
