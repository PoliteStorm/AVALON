Project Title: Universal Signal Encoding in Mycelium Networks via Temporal Transform Framework

Objective:
To demonstrate that mycelial electrochemical action potentials form unique, structured fingerprints that encode spatial and temporal memory, modulated by electromagnetic (EM) interaction — and to decode this using a universal transform framework capable of producing a Rosetta Stone for biological-electric signal language.

1. Signal Transform Equation:
   W(k, τ) = ∫₀^∞ V(t) · ψ(√t / τ) · e^(−ik√t) dt

   - V(t): Recorded electrical potential spikes from mycelium.
   - ψ(·): Localized kernel function (e.g., wavelet or custom biological basis function).
   - τ: Scale parameter controlling resolution in time domain.
   - k: Frequency-mode selector, akin to "decision channel" or behavioral band.

2. Interaction Sum Model:
   S(t) = ∑[s_i(t) + τ(s_i, s_j, φ)]

   - s_i(t): Local node signal (e.g., electrode at a fungal node).
   - τ(s_i, s_j, φ): Interaction effect between fungal nodes i and j modulated by environmental/phase variable φ (e.g., humidity, EM field, nutrient).
   - φ: Environmental phase (global or local), enabling contextual encoding.

3. Grounding Modulation Layer:
   V_mod(t) = V(t) · G(t, x)

   - G(t, x): Environmental modulation function incorporating:
     - Grounding potential
     - Local EM noise/interference
     - Shielding status (e.g., Faraday cage presence)
   - V_mod(t): Modified potential function representing true state of fungal communication under real-world conditions.

4. Purpose:
   - Generate a Rosetta Stone of signal-response patterns from mycelium.
   - Track how EM and grounding conditions affect decision-like spikes.
   - Build a foundation for universal biological signal encoding models.

Applications:
   - Biocomputing & fungal-based logic
   - Electromagnetic environmental sensing via bio-networks
   - Understanding distributed cognition in biological systems
   - Natural, encrypted communication networks
