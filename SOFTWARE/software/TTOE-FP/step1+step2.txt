## Abstract

This paper presents a novel hybrid analytical framework for deciphering fungal communication signals by combining two complementary models: the original Fungal Rosetta Stone system and a newly developed Nested Symbolic Equation model. The original system employs biological and linguistic principles to decode fungal spike trains into recognizable “words” based on frequency, duration, and amplitude parameters, leveraging established vocabularies derived from Adamatzky's research. The new Nested Symbolic Equation model probes deeper hierarchical and recursive signal structures, applying layered energy transformations and triangle-based symbolic motifs to detect hidden complexities beyond the scope of traditional lexical mapping.

This combination provides both biological interpretability and novel insights into previously unrecognized symbolic organization, offering significant potential to reveal unknown communicative behaviors and deepen our understanding of fungal information processing.

## Introduction

Fungi communicate through intricate electrical spike trains, which have been partially decoded using biological and linguistic analogies. The original Fungal Rosetta Stone system developed here quantifies spike characteristics, maps patterns to a fungal “lexicon,” and identifies anomalous or novel words, yielding meaningful insights into species-specific communication.

However, fungal signals may encode additional hidden layers of symbolic complexity. To explore this, a Nested Symbolic Equation model was introduced, which analyzes the recursive energy architecture of signals by layering strings and embedding triangle patterns within signal transformations. This approach aims to detect hierarchical signal structuring and emergent symbolic behaviors potentially representing an advanced fungal language system.

## Methods

### Original Fungal Rosetta Stone Model

- **Input:** Spike train data (timing, amplitude).
- **Processing:** Wavelet transform extracts frequency and timescale features.
- **Lexicon Matching:** Pattern complexity and vocabulary matching based on known fungal words.
- **Output:** Pattern names, complexity scores, and discovery potential flags.

### Nested Symbolic Equation Model

- **Input:** Same spike train data.
- **Processing:** Multi-layered recursive transformations encode signal energy.
- **Triangle Embedding:** Symbolic geometric shapes modeled mathematically to represent nested communication layers.
- **Output:** Energy complexity scores and symbolic pattern classification.

### Hybrid Integration

- Step 1: Apply Rosetta Stone decoding to identify known or novel fungal words.
- Step 2: For unknown or ambiguous signals, apply the Nested Symbolic Equation model.
- Step 3: Use combined results to classify signals into known vocabulary, unknown symbolic complexity, or high-priority discovery candidates.

## Results and Discussion

The hybrid approach bridges biological realism and mathematical abstraction:

- The Rosetta Stone successfully decodes spikes into linguistic units with biological relevance.
- The Nested Symbolic Equation detects recursive energy patterns and triangle embeddings that the original model misses, highlighting signals with high symbolic complexity.
- Together, the models provide complementary perspectives: lexical decoding and hierarchical symbolic pattern recognition.

This layered methodology aligns with the hypothesis that fungal communication involves both discrete “words” and embedded symbolic structures, analogous to nested syntax or grammatical recursion in human languages.

## Potential and Future Work

This hybrid system lays the groundwork for a more complete fungal communication Rosetta Stone:

- **Extended Data Collection:** Applying this model to larger, multi-species fungal datasets to validate symbolic patterns.
- **Refined Symbolic Mappings:** Developing explicit mappings of triangle and layered structures to biological or ecological functions.
- **Machine Learning Integration:** Using hybrid model outputs as features to train classifiers or language models for automated fungal language recognition.
- **Cross-disciplinary Insights:** Bridging biology, linguistics, and symbolic mathematics to understand fungal intelligence and communication.

By expanding the analytical toolkit beyond traditional frequency and amplitude analysis, this work opens new avenues for deciphering complex fungal signaling and contributes to the broader field of biosemiotics.

## Conclusion

The integration of the Fungal Rosetta Stone model with the Nested Symbolic Equation model represents a significant step toward decoding fungal communication’s full complexity. This hybrid framework harnesses both biological interpretability and novel symbolic analysis, providing a powerful approach to uncovering unknown communicative behaviors and deepening our understanding of fungal information systems.

## Code Integration (Summary)

The original Rosetta Stone Python script analyzes spike trains for known fungal words using wavelet transforms and lexical matching. The new script implements nested recursive energy transformations and symbolic triangle embeddings to evaluate signal complexity.

The integrated pipeline first decodes signals using the original model and then applies the nested symbolic analysis to signals flagged as unknown or complex. This layered approach combines the strengths of both models, improving interpretability and discovery potential.
