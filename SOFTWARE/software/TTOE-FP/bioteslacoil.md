# Practical Guide: Building Bio-Tesla Coils with Mycelial Networks

## How to Actually Do This - Simple Steps

### Phase 1: START SMALL (Lab Bench Setup)

**Basic Materials:**
- Petri dishes with mushroom growing medium
- 3D print simple coil-shaped tracks/channels
- Grow mycelium along the coil paths using nutrient gradients
- Stick electrodes at different points to measure voltage

**What You're Testing:**
- Can mycelium follow geometric patterns?
- Does growth direction affect electrical output?
- Are coil shapes measurably different from random growth?

### Phase 2: TEST THE BASICS

**Measurement Protocol:**
- Measure natural electrical output (should get millivolts like your simulator)
- Try different coil shapes - tight spirals vs loose spirals
- Test triangular arrangements of growth points
- See if certain geometries give higher voltage readings

**Key Comparisons:**
- Straight line growth vs spiral growth
- Single coil vs multiple connected coils
- Triangle arrangements vs random clusters
- Different species in same geometries

### Phase 3: ADD AMPLIFICATION

**Stimulation Methods:**
- Use tiny speakers/vibrators to "tickle" the mycelium at different frequencies
- Try LED lights pulsing at calculated frequencies from your W-transform
- Use small electromagnets to create oscillating fields
- Measure if any of this increases the electrical output

**Test Parameters:**
- Frequency ranges: 0.1 Hz to 100 Hz
- Amplitude variations
- Pulse patterns vs continuous stimulation
- Timing with natural mycelial rhythms

### Phase 4: SCALE UP GRADUALLY

**Expansion Strategy:**
- Move from petri dishes to larger growing trays
- Build wooden frames in coil/triangle shapes for mycelium to grow through
- Connect multiple geometric units together
- Test if networks amplify better than individual units

**Network Configurations:**
- Series connections (coils connected end-to-end)
- Parallel connections (coils connected side-by-side)
- Hybrid geometric patterns
- 3D arrangements using multiple layers
